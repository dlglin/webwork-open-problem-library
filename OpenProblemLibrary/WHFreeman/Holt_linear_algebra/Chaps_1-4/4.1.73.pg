BEGIN_PGML
In the chemical reaction

        [`` x_1C_6H_{12}O_6 \rightarrow x_2C_2H_5OH + x_3CO_2 ``]

[`x_1`] molecules of glucose ([`C_6H_{12}O_6`]) ferment to form [`x_2`] molecules of alcohol ([`C_2H_5OH`]) and [`x_3`] molecules of carbon dioxide ([`CO_2`]).

One may regard triples of values [`x_1,x_2,x_3`] that balance this reaction as  components of vectors [``\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3\end{bmatrix}``] that live in a certain subspace [`S\subseteq \mathbb{R}^3`].  In our case it turns out that this subspace [`S`] is spanned by a single vector [`A\in \mathbb{R}^3`]

        [``S = \text{span}\big(\{A\}\big)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^3``] .
    
    Find a vector [`A`] that spans the subspace [`S`].

        [`A`] = [_]*{$ans->cmp(parallel=>1)}

(Of course the numbers [`x_1,x_2,x_3`] are expected to be nonnegative in the chemical reaction formula, so in real life one would require that condition too.)

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Chemical reactions can change molecules by rearranging the atoms in the molecules, but they can't change the atoms themselves, so the number of atoms of each type that are present is the same at the beginning of the reaction and at the end.

Each molecule of glucose ([`C_6H_{12}O_6`]) contains 6 atoms of Carbon, 12 atoms of Hydrogen, and 6 atoms of Oxygen, 

A molecule of alcohol ([`C_2H_5OH`]) contains 2 atoms of Carbon, 5 atoms of Hydrogen, 1 atom of Oxygen, and 1 more atom of Hydrogen so it has a total of 6 atoms of Hydrogen, 5 atoms of Hydrogen, 1 atom of Oxygen.  

A molecule of carbon dioxide ([`CO_2`]) has 1 Carbon atom and 2 Oxygen atoms.

So [`x_1`] molecules of glucose have [`6x_1`] atoms of Carbon, [`12x_1`] atoms of Hydrogen, and [`6x_1`] atoms of Oxygen.

[`x_2`] molecules of alcohol have [`2x_2`] atoms of Carbon, [`6x_2`] atoms of Hydrogen, and [`x_2`] atoms of Oxygen.

[`x_3`] molecules of carbon dioxide have [`x_3`] atoms of Carbon and [`2x_3`] atoms of Oxygen.

Thus the reaction begins with [`6x_1`] atoms of Carbon in the glucose, and ends with [`2x_2+x_3`] atoms of Carbon  in the alcohol and carbon dioxide, so 

    [`6x_1 = 2x_2+x_3`].

Also it begins with [`12x_1`] atoms of Hydrogen in the glucose and ends with [`6x_2+0x_3`] atoms of Hydrogen in the alcohol and carbon dioxide, so 

    [`12x_1=6x_2+0x_3`].

Lastly it begins with [`6x_1`] atoms of Oxygen in the glucose and ends with [`x_2+2x_3`] atoms of Oxygen in the alcohol and carbon dioxide, so 

    [`6x_1 = x_2+2x_3`]

Therefore we have a system of three linear equations in three unknowns.  

    [``\begin{aligned} 
    6x_1 &= 2x_2+x_3\\
    12x_1 &=6x_2+0x_3\\
    6x_1 &= x_2+2x_3
    \end{aligned} ``]

The second equation says 

    [`2x_1 = x_2`].

Substituting that into the first equation we obtain

    [`2x_1 = x_3`]

and the third equation becomes [`6x_1=6x_1`] which is automatically true.  Thus [`x_1`] parametrizes a one-parameter family of solutions, 

    [``\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ 2x_1 \\ 2x_1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2\\ 2 \end{bmatrix} x_1 ``].

Therefore [`S`] is spanned by the vector

    [``A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}``]

(Of course any nonzero multiple of [`A`] would also span [`S`].)
