BEGIN_PGML
You have a wire that is [$length] cm long.  You wish to cut it into two pieces.
One piece will be bent into the shape of a square.  The other piece 
will be bent into the shape of a circle.  Let [`A\  \text{cm}^2`] be
the total area inside the square and the circle.  What is the circumference of the
circle if [`A`] is minimized?

The circumference of the circle is  

    circumference = [_]{$ans}{10} cm.
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let 

    [`x`] cm = length of one side of the square
    
    [`r`] cm = radius of the circle.
    
The total area is the area of the square plus the area of the circle

    [`A=x^2+\pi r^2`]

Also it takes [$length] cm of wire to make the square and the circle so 

    [``\begin{aligned}
    [$length]&= \text{perimeter of square} + \text{circumference of circle} \\
    &= 4x + 2\pi r \end{aligned}``]

thus

    [``x=\frac{[$length]-2\pi r}{4}``],
    
and

    A = [``\Big(\frac{[$length]-2\pi r}{4}\Big)^2 + \pi r^2 ``]
    
Multiply out the right hand side to obtain

    [``\begin{aligned} 
    A &= \frac{[$length]^2}{16} - 
    \frac{([$length])4\pi}{16} r + 
    \frac{4 \pi^2 }{16}r^2 + \pi r^2 \\
   &= \frac{[$length]^2}{16}- 
   \Big(\frac{[$length]\pi}{4}\Big) r 
   + \Big(\frac{\pi^2 }{4} + \pi\Big) r^2
    \end{aligned} ``]
    
The formula for the vertex of a parabola says that the [`A=c+br+ar^2`] is minimized when [``r=\frac{-b}{2a}``] so our [`A`] is minimized when

    [``r = \frac{[$length]\pi/4}{2(\pi^2/4+\pi)} = \frac{[$length]/4}{\pi/2+2} = \frac{[$length]}{2\pi+8}``]  
    
and the circumference of the circle is 

    circumference = [`2\pi r`] = [``\frac{([$length])\pi}{\pi+4}``]
