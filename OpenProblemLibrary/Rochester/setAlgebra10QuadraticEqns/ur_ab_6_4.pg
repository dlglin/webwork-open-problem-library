BEGIN_PGML;
A factory is to be built on a lot measuring [$B] ft by [$lotlength] ft.  A local building code specifies that a lawn of uniform width and equal in area to the factory must surround the factory.

What must the width of the lawn be? [_]{$W}{10} ft.
   
If the dimensions of the factory are [` A `] ft by [` B `] ft with [` A < B `], then 

    [` A = `] [_]{$A}{10} and [` B = `] [_]{$B}{10} 
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let
    [`W`] ft. = width of the lawn.
    
The lawn surrounds the factory so the factory plus the lawn occupy a big rectangle that is 

    [`A+2W`] feet wide and
    
    [`B+2W`] feet long,
    
Assuming that this big rectangle fills the whole lot and [`A<B`] we have

    [`[$B]=A+2W`] and [`[$lotlength]=B+2W`]

so

    [`A=[$B]-2W`] and [`B=[$lotlength]-2W`]


Also the building code says the area of the lawn equals the area [`AB`] occupied by the factory, so together they occupy twice the area of the factory

    area of lot = [`([$B])([$lotlength]) = 2AB`]
    
Thus

    [``\begin{gathered}
    ([$B])([$lotlength]) = 
      2([$B]-2W)([$lotlength]-2W)\\
    [$lotarea] = 2\Big([$lotarea]-
    ([$lottwosides])2W+4W^2\Big)\\
    0 = [$lotarea]-4([$lottwosides])W+8W^2 
    \end{gathered}``]
    
Divide by 8 and factor (or use the quadratic formula)

    [``\begin{gathered} 0 = [@ 150*$n**2 @] - [@ 35*$n @]W + W^2\\
    0=([$B]-W)([$W]-W)\end{gathered} ``]
    
    [``W = [$B] \text{ or } W=[$W]``]
 
If [`W=[$B]`] then [`A=[$B]-2W = [$B]-2([$B])`] is negative, which doesn't make sense.  So 
    [`W = [$W]`]
    
    [`A=[$B]-2W=[$A]`] and 
    
    [`B=[$lotlength]-2W=[$B]`]
