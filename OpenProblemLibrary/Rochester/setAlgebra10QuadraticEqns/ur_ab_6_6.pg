The area of a rectangle is $a [`\ \text{cm}^2`], and its perimeter is $p cm. Find the lengths of its sides and its diagonal.

    longer side length = [_]{$c} cm. 
    
    shorter side length = [_]{$b} cm.
    
    diagonal length = [_]{$d} [`\text{cm}^2`].
EOT

$sol[0]=<<EOT;
Assume the rectangle measures [`x`] cm by [`y`] cm.  The
length of its perimeter is is [`$p = 2(x+y)`] cm. so

    [`y=$p/2-x=$halfp-x`].
    
The area is $a [`\text{cm}^2`] so 

    [``\begin{aligned} $a &= xy = x($halfp -x)\\ 
     $a &= $halfp x - x^2\\
     0 &= x^2 - $halfp x + $a\\
     0 &= (x-$b)(x-$c) \end{aligned}``]
     
Thus 

    longer side length = $c cm 
    
    shorter side length = $b cm.
    
    diagonal length = [`\sqrt{$c^2+$b^2}`] cm.

EOT

$ques[1] = <<EOT;
The perimeter of a rectangle is $p cm. and the length
of its diagonal is [``\sqrt{$dsqr}``] cm.  Find the lengths of its sides and its area.

    longer side length = [_]{$c} cm.

    shorter side length = [_]{$b} cm.
    
    area = [_]{$a} [`\text{cm}^2`]
EOT

$sol[1] = <<EOT;
Assume the rectangle measures [`x`] cm by [`y`] cm.  The length of its perimeter is is [`$p = 2x+2y`] cm. so

    [`y=$p/2-x=$halfp-x`].

and the length of its diagonal is [`\sqrt{$dsqr}`] cm. so 

 [``\begin{aligned} 
    $dsqr =& x^2+y^2 = x^2 + ($halfp -x)^2 \\
    $dsqr =& 2x^2 - $p x + $halfpsq\\
    0=&&2x^2-$p x + $a2\\
    =& 2(x-$b)(x-$c)\end{aligned}``] 
  
Thus 

    longer side length = $c cm 
    
    shorter side length $b cm. long.
    
    area = $a [`\text{cm}^2`]

EOT

$ques[2] =<<EOT ;
The area of a rectangle is $a [``\text{cm}^2``],  and 
the length of its diagonal 
is [`\sqrt{$dsqr}`] cm.  Find the lengths of its sides and perimeter.

    longer side length = [_]{$c} cm.

    shorter side length = [_]{$b} cm.
    
    perimeter length = [_]{$p} cm.
EOT

$sol[2]=<<EOT;
Assume the rectangle measures [`x`] cm by [`y`] cm.  
Its area in square cm. is $a = [`xy`] so 

    [``y = \frac{$a}{x}``]
    
and its diagonal is [`\sqrt{$dsqr}=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}`] cm. so

    [``$dsqr = x^2+y^2 = x^2+\frac{$a^2}{x^2}``]
    
Multiply both sides of this equation by [`x^2`] to obtain

    [``$dsqr x^2 = \big(x^2\big)^2 + $a^2 ``]
    
so 

    [``0 = \big(x^2\big)^2 - $dsqr(x^2) + $a^2 ``].
    
One can use the quadratic formula to solve this equation for [`x^2`]

    [``x^2 = \frac{$dsqr \pm \sqrt{$dsqr^2 - 4($a^2)}}{2}``]
    
so there are two possible values for [`x^2`]:

    [`x^2`]= [``\frac{$dsqr + \sqrt{$dsqr^2 - 4($a^2)}}{2}=$csq``] 
    
or 

    [`x^2`]=[``\frac{$dsqr - \sqrt{$dsqr^2 - 4($a^2)}}{2}=$bsq``]
    
and four possible values for [`x`]

    [``x=\pm \sqrt{$csq} = \pm $c \quad\text{or}\quad x=\pm \sqrt{$bsq} = \pm $b``]
    
Only the positive values make sense because [`x`] represents the length of a side of the rectangle,
so only two possibilities remain

    [`x = $c \quad\text{or}\quad x = $b`]

The larger of these two values must represent the length in cm. of the larger side of the rectangle and the smaller value must represent the length of the smaller side. 

The perimeter is twice the sum of these two values

    perimeter = $p cm.
