BEGIN_PGML
NASA fires a projectile at time [`t = 0`] seconds.  After it is fired the altitude of the projectile, in meters above 
sea-level, is given by [`h(t) = -4.9t^2 + [$v] t + [$h]`] as a function of time.

Assuming that the projectile will splash down into the ocean, at what time does
splashdown occur?

The projectile splashes down after [_]{$time}{10} seconds.

How high above sea-level does the projectile get at its peak?

The projectile peaks at [_]{$peak}{10} meters above sea-level.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
When the projectile splashes down its altitude is zero, so one can find the time when splashdown happens by solving the equation

    [``0=h(t)=-4.9t^2 + [$v] t + [$h]``]
    
for [`t`].  The quadratic formula gives the solution

    [``t_{\text{splash}} = \frac{-[$v]\pm \sqrt{[$v]^2-(4)(-4.9)([$h])}}{(2)(-4.9)}``]
    
Only the positive solution makes sense in this problem, so the shell splashes down when

    [``t_{\text{splash}} = \frac{-[$v]- \sqrt{[$v]^2-(4)(-4.9)([$h])}}{(2)(-4.9)} \approx [$time]``]

seconds after firing.

The path of the shell is a parabola so its highest point is its vertex.  The time when it reaches its highest point is the [`t`]-coordinate of the vertex

    [``t_{\text{vertex}} = \frac{-[$v]}{(2)(-4.9)} \approx [$t_vertex]``]
    
so its altitude at its highest point (its "peak") is 

    [``h(t_{vertex}) = (-4.9)t_{vertex}^2+[$v] t_{vertex} + [$h] \approx [$peak]``] 
    
meters above sea level.
