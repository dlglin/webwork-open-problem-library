Find all real solutions of equation [`[$f] = 0`].

Does the equation have real solutions? [_]{$YN}
 
If your answer is *Yes*, input the solutions. Otherwise leave the following answers blank.
  
[` x = `] [_]{str_cmp($ans1)}{20} or [` x_2 = `] [_]{str_cmp($ans2)}{20} 
  
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The quadratic formula says the solutions to this quadratic equation 
are 

[``x = \frac{-[$b]\pm \sqrt{[$b]^2 - 4([$a])([$c])}}{2([$a])}``].

But [``\sqrt{[$b]^2 - 4([$a])([$c])}``] is not a real number because [``[$b]^2 - 4([$a])([$c])``] is negative, and square roots of negative numbers are not real numbers.  Thus the solutions are not real numbers, so the equation has no real roots.
