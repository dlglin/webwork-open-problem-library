$w =  Real(random(10,80,5));
$h =  Real(random(5,20,5));
$l = $w+$h;
$area = $w*($l);

BEGIN_PGML;
A rectangular garden is [$h] ft longer than it is wide.
Its area is [$area] ft[`{}^2`]. What are its dimensions?
   
The garden is [_]{$w}{20} ft. wide and [_]{$w+$h}{20}ft. long.
  
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let
    [`L`] ft. = Length of garden
    
    [`W`] ft. = Width of garden
    
The length is [$h] ft. longer than the width so

    [`L=W+[$h]`]
    
Also the area is [`LW=[$area]`] square feet 
so 

    [`[$area]=LW=(W+[$h])W =W^2+[$h]W`]
    
and

    [``\begin{aligned}0&=W^2+[$h]W-[$area]\\
       &=(W-[$w])(W+[$l])\end{aligned}``]
       
Thus

    [`W=[$w]`] or [`W=-[$l]`].
    
The second possibility [`W=-[$l]`] says the width is negative, which doesn't make sense.  Thus we must have 

    [`W=[$w]`] ft. and [`L=[$w]+[$h]=[$l]`] ft.
