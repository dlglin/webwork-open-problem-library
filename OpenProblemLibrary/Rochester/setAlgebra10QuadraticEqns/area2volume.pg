$ans = Real(($SA/6)**(3/2));

BEGIN_PGML
The surface area of a cube is [``[$SA] \text{ cm}^2``].  What is the volume of the cube?

*Note:*  Your answer must be a number.  It may not contain any arithmetic
operations.

    The volume of the cube is  [_]{$ans} [``\text{cm}^3``]    
(approximately).
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let [`S`] cm. be the length of one side of the cube.  The volume of the cube is    
    Volume = [``S^3 \text{ cm}^3``]     
so if one knows what [`S`] is then finding the answer is easy.  We also know the cube's surface area; what does that tell us?  The surface of the cube consists of six squares, each square measuring [`S`] cm on a side, so the surface area of the cube is    
    [``[$SA]\text{ cm}^2``] = Surface Area = (6)(area of square) = [``6S^2\text{ cm}^2``]    
Solving for [`S`] one finds
    [``S = \sqrt{[$SA]/6}``]    
and so the volume is    
    Volume = [``\Big(\sqrt{[$SA]/6}\Big)^3 \approx [$ans] \text{ cm}^3``]
