    The speed of a particle is defined as the magnitude of its velocity vector, not the normalized velocity. The correct formula for speed is \(|r'(t)|\), where \(r'(t)\) is the velocity vector. The given expression \(\frac{r'(t)}{|r'(t)|}\) would always have a magnitude of 1, representing only the direction of motion, not the speed. ",
    "$BBOLD False $EBOLD 
    $BR
    \(u \cdot v\) is a scalar (dot product), not a vector. The cross product \(u Ã— v\) would give a vector orthogonal to both u and v, but not the dot product.",
    "$BBOLD False $EBOLD 
    $BR
The sphere equation represents points whose distance from the center (2, -1, 3) equals the radius \(\sqrt{25} = 5\). Substituting (2, -1, 3) into the equation results in all squared terms becoming zero. Since any distance squared is non-negative, the equation reduces to \(0 = 25\), which is never true. This mathematical contradiction confirms (2, -1, 3) is not on the sphere. ",
    "$BBOLD False $EBOLD 
    $BR
    The correct differentiation of \(u(t) \times u(t)\) (cross product of a vector with itself) with respect to \(t\) is \(u'(t) \times u(t) + u(t) \times u'(t) \). Note also that the cross product of a vector with itself happens to be zero. But either way the statement is false because it does not use the correct differentiation formula.",
